# 2020 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT - SANTORINI

This is an implementation of a board game called Santorini

## How to compile

In order to create the jar file you simply have to package the project with maven using the code "mvn package"

## How to play

In order to start to play you have to run a server and 2 or 3 clients.
As you run the exported jar file press 0 to run server and 1 to run one client.
If you have chosen to run the client you have to select between CLI (press 1) and GUI (press 0).
We suggest playing it in GUI. As the game starts you will enter your nickname and birthday.
You will not have the chance to do an illegal move. 
You only have to select your move the move that you want to do from a range of possible moves calculated by the server.
A wrong input will only involve in a new try to enter the right input.
