## How to build and start the game

In order to create the jar file you simply have to package the project with maven using 
```shell script
mvn package
```
The jar file will be created in the directory of the deliveries in a subfolder called jar.
In order to run the jar once created simply open a terminal and run the following commands:
```shell script
cd deliveries/jar
java -jar PS60.jar
```
Maven and java is requested in order to build and run this application

## How to play

In order to start to play you have to run a server and 2 or 3 clients.
As you run the exported jar file press 0 to run server and 1 to run one client.
If you have chosen to run the client you have to select between CLI (press 1) and GUI (press 0).
We suggest playing it in GUI. As the game starts you will enter your nickname and birthday.
You will not have the chance to do an illegal move. 
You only have to select your move that you want to do from a range of possible moves calculated by the server.
A wrong input will only involve in a new try to enter a right input.
